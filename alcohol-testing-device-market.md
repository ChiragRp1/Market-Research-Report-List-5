<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alcohol Testing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alcohol testing devices can be classified into two main types: contact and contactless. Contact devices require the individual to blow into a tube or breathe into a sensor directly, while contactless devices use technology such as infrared spectroscopy to measure blood alcohol concentration without physical contact. Both types of devices are used to detect alcohol levels in breath and determine whether an individual is under the influence of alcohol. Contact devices are typically more portable and convenient, while contactless devices may offer faster and more accurate results.</p></p>
