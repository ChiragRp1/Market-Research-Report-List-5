<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dynamic Type</li><li>Static Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) technology is available in two market types: Dynamic Type and Static Type. The Dynamic Type adjusts the beam pattern according to the surrounding conditions in real-time, such as oncoming vehicles or streetlights. On the other hand, the Static Type is pre-set and does not change its beam pattern once activated. Both types aim to improve visibility while driving at night, but the Dynamic Type offers more flexibility and responsiveness to changing environments compared to the Static Type.</p></p>
