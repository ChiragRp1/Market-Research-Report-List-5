<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR system</li><li>EGR system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Market includes two main types of technologies - Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system. SCR systems use a catalyst to convert harmful nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water, reducing emissions. EGR systems recirculate exhaust gases back into the engine cylinders to reduce combustion temperatures and lower nitrogen oxide emissions. Both systems are crucial for commercial vehicles to comply with emissions regulations and reduce their environmental impact.</p></p>
