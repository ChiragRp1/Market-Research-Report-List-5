<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LVDT Displacement Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LVDT Displacement Sensors are used in various industries for measuring and monitoring linear displacement. There are two main types of LVDT sensors in the market: contact and non-contact. Contact LVDT sensors physically touch the object being measured, providing accurate and precise readings. On the other hand, non-contact LVDT sensors use electromagnetic fields to measure displacement without touching the object, making them suitable for applications where physical contact is not possible or desired. Both types offer unique advantages and are chosen based on specific requirements of each application.</p></p>
