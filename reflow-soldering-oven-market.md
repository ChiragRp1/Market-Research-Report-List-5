<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflow Soldering Oven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Convection Ovens</li><li>Vapour Phase Ovens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reflow soldering ovens are primarily divided into two types: convection ovens and vapour phase ovens. Convection ovens use hot air to melt solder paste, creating a reflow process. Vapour phase ovens, on the other hand, use a special liquid with a lower boiling point than solder to create a more controlled heating process. Convection ovens are more commonly used due to their cost-effectiveness and versatility, while vapour phase ovens are preferred for their precise temperature control and ability to solder complex components.</p></p>
