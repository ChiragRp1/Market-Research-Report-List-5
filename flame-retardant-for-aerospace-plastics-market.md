<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant for Aerospace Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Additive</li><li>Reactive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardants for aerospace plastics can be classified into two types - additive and reactive. Additive flame retardants are chemicals added to the plastic material during processing to reduce flammability. They work by releasing gases that dilute the flammable gases produced during combustion. Reactive flame retardants are chemically bound to the polymer matrix and become an integral part of the material, providing long-lasting flame retardancy. Both types are crucial for ensuring the safety and compliance of aerospace materials with stringent fire safety regulations.</p></p>
