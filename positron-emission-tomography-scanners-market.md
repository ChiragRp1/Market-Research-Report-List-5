<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positron Emission Tomography Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Ring PET Scanners</li><li>Partial Ring PET Scanners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scanners are used in medical imaging to detect diseases and conditions in the body. There are two main types of PET Scanners - Full Ring PET Scanners and Partial Ring PET Scanners. Full Ring PET Scanners provide more complete image data due to the complete ring of detectors surrounding the patient. Partial Ring PET Scanners, on the other hand, have detectors on only one side, resulting in less comprehensive image data. Both types have their advantages and limitations in the medical imaging industry.</p></p>
