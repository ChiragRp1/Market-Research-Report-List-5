<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto-transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase</li><li>Three-Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Auto-transformers are commonly classified into two types based on the number of phases: Single Phase and Three-Phase. Single Phase auto-transformers have a single input and output voltage winding, suitable for applications where only one phase is required. Three-Phase auto-transformers have three input and output voltage windings, ideal for systems requiring power distribution to multiple phases. Both types of auto-transformers provide a more efficient and cost-effective solution compared to traditional transformers by sharing a common winding for both the primary and secondary circuits.</p></p>
