<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microfluidic Flow Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microfluidic flow sensors can be classified into two main types: non-contact type and contact type. Non-contact type sensors use technologies such as ultrasonic waves or optical sensors to measure flow rates without physically touching the fluid. On the other hand, contact type sensors rely on physical contact with the fluid to measure flow rates using methods like pressure sensors or thermal sensors. Both types of sensors have their own advantages and are used in various applications depending on the specific requirements of the system.</p></p>
