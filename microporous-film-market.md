<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microporous Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional Stretching</li><li>Biaxial Stretching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microporous films are produced through two main stretching methods - unidirectional stretching and biaxial stretching. Unidirectional stretching involves stretching the film in one direction, while biaxial stretching involves stretching it in two directions simultaneously. Both methods result in the creation of micropores within the film, which improve its breathability and moisture vapor transmission properties. These different stretching techniques provide manufacturers with versatile options for producing microporous films tailored to specific applications in industries such as healthcare, packaging, and textiles.</p></p>
