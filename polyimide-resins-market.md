<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyimide resins are widely used in the market in two primary forms - thermoplastics and thermosetting resins. Thermoplastics soften when heated and then harden again when cooled, allowing for flexibility and reshaping. Thermosetting resins, on the other hand, undergo a chemical reaction when heated and hardened and cannot be reshaped once cooled. Both types of polyimide resins have their own unique properties and applications, making them essential materials in various industries such as aerospace, electronics, and automotive.</p></p>
