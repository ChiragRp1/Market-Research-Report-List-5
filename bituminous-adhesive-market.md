<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bituminous Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Applied</li><li>Hot Applied</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bituminous adhesive is a widely used construction material with two main types based on application methods: cold-applied and hot-applied. Cold-applied bituminous adhesives are generally solvent-based and can be applied at ambient temperatures, making them convenient for certain applications. On the other hand, hot-applied adhesives require heating before application, creating a strong bond once cooled. The choice between the two types depends on factors such as project requirements, temperature conditions, and ease of application.</p></p>
