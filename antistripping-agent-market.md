<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antistripping Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Amine Anti-stripping Agent</li><li>Lime Anti-stripping Agent</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antistripping agents are divided into different types based on their composition and mechanisms of action. Amine antistripping agents work by forming bonds with both the asphalt and aggregate, improving the adhesion between the two. Lime antistripping agents, on the other hand, work by modifying the surface chemistry of the aggregate, making it more receptive to the asphalt binder. Another market for antistripping agents includes various additives and modifiers that enhance the bond between asphalt and aggregate in different ways, providing options for tailored solutions in pavement construction.</p></p>
