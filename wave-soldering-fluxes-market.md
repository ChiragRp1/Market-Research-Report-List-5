<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wave Soldering Fluxes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corrosive</li><li>Noncorrosive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wave soldering fluxes are categorized into two main types: corrosive and noncorrosive. Corrosive fluxes are aggressive in nature and can potentially damage electronic components if not cleaned properly after soldering. Noncorrosive fluxes, on the other hand, are milder and do not pose a risk of damage to the components. The choice between the two types depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired level of cleanliness needed after soldering.</p></p>
