<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market consists of two types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors placed in each tire to directly measure the air pressure and transmit the data to the driver. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, relies on the wheel speed sensors already present in the vehicle to detect changes in tire pressure based on changes in tire circumference. Both types of TPMS systems are designed to alert drivers of any tire pressure issues to ensure safe driving conditions.</p></p>
