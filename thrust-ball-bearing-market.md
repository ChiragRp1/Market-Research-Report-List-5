<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrust Ball Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-direction Bearings</li><li>Double-direction Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thrust ball bearings are categorized into two main types based on the direction of the axial load they can accommodate. Single-direction bearings can only support axial loads in one direction, while double-direction bearings can handle axial loads in both directions. Single-direction bearings are commonly used in applications where the load is predominantly in one direction, such as in conveyor systems. Double-direction bearings are suitable for applications where the load can vary in direction, such as in gearboxes or automotive transmissions.</p></p>
