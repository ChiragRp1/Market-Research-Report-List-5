<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Beauty Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasion</li><li>Non-abrasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser beauty machines can be categorized into two main types: abrasion and non-abrasive. Abrasion machines use lasers to remove the outer layers of the skin to treat issues such as scars, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. Non-abrasive machines, on the other hand, do not remove the skin's outer layer but instead penetrate deeper into the skin to stimulate collagen production or target specific skin concerns. Both types of machines have their own advantages and are chosen based on individual needs and desired results.</p></p>
