<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Moisture Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volumetric</li><li>Soil Water Potential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water moisture sensors can be classified into two main types, volumetric and soil water potential sensors. Volumetric sensors measure the actual amount of water present in the soil, usually expressed as a percentage of the soil volume. On the other hand, soil water potential sensors measure the energy state of water in the soil, indicating how easy or difficult it is for plants to extract water. Both types of sensors are valuable tools for optimizing irrigation practices and improving crop yield in agriculture.</p></p>
