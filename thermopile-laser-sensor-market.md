<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermopile Laser Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volume Absorber Sensors</li><li>Surface Absorber Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermopile laser sensors are categorized into two main types based on their design and function - Volume Absorber Sensors and Surface Absorber Sensors. Volume Absorber Sensors have an absorber material inside the sensor that captures and converts laser energy into heat, which is then detected by the thermopile. On the other hand, Surface Absorber Sensors have a thin coating on their surface that absorbs the laser energy directly, producing a thermal response that is measured by the thermopile. Both types are widely used in various industries for precise and accurate laser power measurements.</p></p>
