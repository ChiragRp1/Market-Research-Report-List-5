<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detect Only One Species</li><li>Detect Multiple Species</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are available in two main types in the market: those that detect only one species of malaria parasite, and those that detect multiple species. RDTs that detect only one species are commonly used in areas where a specific type of malaria is dominant. On the other hand, RDTs that detect multiple species are more versatile and can be used in regions where different types of malaria parasites coexist. Both types of RDTs play a crucial role in accurate and timely diagnosis of malaria.</p></p>
