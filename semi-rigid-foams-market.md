<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-Rigid Foams Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Elastic Modulus</li><li>High Elastic Modulus</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semi-rigid foams can be categorized into two main types based on their elastic modulus: Low Elastic Modulus and High Elastic Modulus. Low Elastic Modulus foams are softer and more flexible, making them ideal for applications where cushioning or impact absorption is needed. On the other hand, High Elastic Modulus foams are stiffer and more rigid, providing better structural support and insulation properties. Both types of foams have their own unique characteristics and applications, catering to different industry needs.</p></p>
