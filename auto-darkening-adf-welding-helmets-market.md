<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Darkening (ADF) Welding Helmets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Shade</li><li>Variable Shade</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fixed shade auto darkening welding helmets have a permanent shade setting that does not change during welding. They provide a consistent level of protection and are often less expensive than variable shade helmets. Variable shade helmets, on the other hand, allow users to adjust the darkness level according to the welding process and environment. They offer more flexibility and precision, but are typically more expensive. Both types of helmets are designed to protect welders from harmful UV and IR radiation during welding processes.</p></p>
